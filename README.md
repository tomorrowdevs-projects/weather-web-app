- Provide the same behavior by input a custom Location
- Webapp should be used from mobile as well
- Use Javascript ES6 syntax and functions
- Deploy the project towards Netlify (www.netlify.com) connected to your GitHub Repo
- After the project is deployed, analyze it with https://web.dev
- Allow the app to be installed on a device
- Allow the app to work offline caching the last provided results (of course search shouldn't work)
